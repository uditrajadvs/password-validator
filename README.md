# Password Validator

Here you have to valide the input from the user. There are 4 constraints that needs to be followed:

- Password must be atleast 8 character in length.
- Password must have atleast one uppercase character.
- Password must have one number.
- Password must have one special character.

If any of these constraints are not met that rule must be styled with the `red-line` css class and use `green-line` css class for those rules that have been statisfied.

Use `&#10004;` this for the tick character.
